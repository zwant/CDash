## Ideas

Two initial levels:
- Team/Service
- Overall

### Deployment/Release
- Deployments overall, per service, per environment
- Number of released stories?

### Builds
- Num builds
- Build times, per service, per stage
- Length of build queues
- Available agents

### Code
- Num commits/PRs
- Sonar stuff?

### Issue tracking
- Num closed tickets vs open tickets

### Tests
- Number of tests ran
- Results pass/fail
- Test run time

#### Screenshots
**Important**: Screenshots are not part of the README, but are an essential part of presenting your plugin successfully. Screenshots are packaged within the /src directory of the plugin itself and specified within plugin.json; more information can be found [here](#). 

## Features

This next section should talk about the features of the plugin within Grafana. 

## External Dependencies

The Installation tab only covers the installation of the plugin itself, so if your plugin relies on external technologies, this is a great place to explain what else a user may need to do.
